Pyzo installation instructions
==============================

Installation should be as easy as downloading the installation file for
your platform. A list of `all available binaries
<https://github.com/pyzo/pyzo/releases>`_ is on Github.

Windows
-------
* The easiest way to install Pyzo on Windows is to use the installer
  (which does not require admin rights).
* Alternatively, you can download and unpack the zip-file. You can place
  the Pyzo directory anywhere you like.

Linux
-----
* To install Pyzo on Linux, download and extract the archive
  corresponding to your architecture. 
* In case you want to place a link on your desktop for convenience,
  icons are in the *source/pyzo/resources/appicons* folder.
* The binaries for Linux are build on a relatively old Linux (currently Ubuntu Pangolin)
  and should therefore work on most modern Linux distros.
* You may be able to install Pyzo using ``apt-get install pyzo`` (not yet).
* You can ``apt-get install python3-pyqt4`` and then ``python3 -m pip install pyzolib pyzo``.

OS X
----
* To install Pyzo on Mac, mount the disk image and copy the pyzo
  directory to to your user directory. 
* The binaries are build on OSX 10.6.2 and should work on Snow Leopard
  and above.

Uninstalling
------------
To remove Pyzo distro, either run the uninstaller (when you used the
installer on Windows), or simply remove the directory that you unpacked
from the archive.

Eula
----
Pyzo distro is free software. No limitations, no DRM. Please read the Pyzo
distro end user agreement for details: `Pyzo EULA
<_static/pyzo_eula.txt>`_.
