`Pyzo <http://pyzo.org>`_ is a free and open-source computing
environment based on Python. Our mission is to make tools for
data-centric programming that are :ref:`easy to obtain <downloads>` and
:ref:`easy to use <whypython>`.

Essentially, Pyzo is a Python distribution that comes with many
scientific :ref:`packages <packages>` and a powerful IDE.
For insiders: Pyzo is based on Python 3, uses Conda for package
management, comes with IPython, and uses `IEP <http://iep-project.org>`_
as the main IDE.
