Pyzo is based on Python 3 (aka Python 3000, aka Python 3k), which is the new version of Python
since december 2008. It took the scientific community a while, but since
2013 all core scientific packages work in Python 3.
Python 3 `is the future <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3>`_
so if you are new to Python, you better start with that right away.

However, not all packages are available in Python 3 yet. In such a case
you can do a couple of things:

  * Ask the developers to make it work in Python 3. If enough users ask
    they might go and work on it.
  * You can help porting the library to Python 3.
  * Maybe you can use an alternative library.
  * If none of the above is possible, you may decide to use Python 2.
