Education
---------

There is plenty of material available on the web to help you learn
Python by yourself. One good place are the `Scipy lectures <http://scipy-lectures.github.io/>`_.
There are also several organizations that provide online courses. And perhaps
your local school or University offers a course as well.

If you want to get started with a certain library, you can in most cases
best have a look at the library's website and search for tutorials and 
documentation. We link to all projects from our :ref:`packages page <packages>`.


Practice
--------

Once you know the basics, it's good to practice your skills in order
to improve them. Here are some sites where you can do that:

  * `Project Euler <http://projecteuler.net/>`_ (mathematical puzzles)
  * `CheckIO <http://www.checkio.org/>`_ (game)
  * `Python challenge <http://www.pythonchallenge.com/>`_ (game with riddles)
  * `Code academy <http://www.codecademy.com/>`_ (nice exercises)


Community
---------

The Python community is known to be large and friendly. Python is used
in a lot of areas, from web frameworks to scripting and GUI design. The
scienfitic community is a fastly growing sub-community with many active
members.

`Scipy.org <http://www.scipy.org>`_ is the best place to start for
the scientific Python community. Pyzo aims to be fully compliant with the
Scipy Stack (a definition of core scientific packages).


Fora and lists
--------------

Typically, each Python library has its own mailing list. 
Here are a few general ones:

  * `Pyzo group <http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyzo>`_
  * `IEP group <http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iep_>`_
  * `Read <http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.scientific.user>`_ or 
    `signup <http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/scipy-user>`_
    for the Scipy mailing list (Scientific Python)
  * `Python group <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/comp.lang.python>`_ 
    (general Python)
