Pyzo is a free and open-source computing environment based on Python.


Technical details
-----------------

Pyzo is based on :ref:`Python 3 <python3>` . It comes with many
scientific :ref:`packages <packages>` and uses `IEP
<http://iep-project.org>`_ as the front-end IDE. It also comes with
IPython (including the notebook).

A notable feature of the distribution is that it is portable. This means
that installation comes down to placing the files in a directory of
your choice; you do not need administration rights to install Pyzo.
Further, you could put Pyzo on an USB stick and use it on any PC.

Pyzo tries to play nice with your system. You can safely install it
without worrying about clashes between other installed Python
interpreters. Multiple versions of Pyzo can also safely be used side
by side. Windows users may want to run “pyzo_activate” to register Pyzo
with the Windows registry, so that you can install additional packages
using binary installers.

Pyzo is based on Conda, a binary package manager developed primarily
by Continuum Analytics. Most binary packages that Pyzo comes with are
also build by Continuum. We are building a few packages ourselves, most
notably PySide and scikit-learn. Being based on Conda means that you
can install any of the packages that are available in (the p3k version
of) Anaconda. 


Support
-------

We do not offer formal support for Pyzo and the packages that it
provides. We do have a `mailing list / forum <http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyzo>`_ 
where we try to answer any questions.

We also have an `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/pyzo/pyzo/issues>`_ 
on Bitbucket. If you have an issue for a certain library, please post the
issue at the corresponding issue tracker. E.g. for issues with IEP,
go to https://bitbucket.org/iep-project/iep/issues/.


Mission
-------

Our mission is to give people easy access to the tools and skills for
data-centric programming. We focus on the Python programming language,
an easy yet powerful language that is very suitable for a wide variety
of tasks; Python is great for learning, science and data analysis, as
well as application development. We are passionate about Python and we
want to give everyone the opportunity to use it. 


Free and Libre
--------------

Pyzo is based on open source software, mostly BSD-licensed (and
therefore usable in commercial applications). We believe that Pyzo
should be free, because:

  * It helps scientist to make their results reproducible (because
    others wont have to buy software).
  * We believe that students should be able to code in a proper
    environment at home too (without having to resort to an illegal
    version).
  * Any researcher, no matter where he/she lives in the world, should
    have access to a powerful computing environment.


About us
--------

During our PhD (at the University of Twente in The Netherlands) we have
come to believe that Python has incredible potential for the use in
science and engineering. We were aware, though, that there was still a
lot of work to do. Pyzo and IEP are our efforts to make data-centric
programing easier accessible.

Pyzo is maintained by Almar Klein and Rob Reilink.
