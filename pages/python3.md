# Python 3 is the future

<img src='Python3-powered_hello-world.png' width='40%' align='center'>

Python 3 has been around since 2008. It took the scientific community until
about 2013 to make the transition.

Python 2 will be deprecated in 2020. Unfortunately, there is still quite a bit of
Python&nbsp;2 code around, also in examples on the web. You should stay
away from those :)
