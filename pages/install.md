# Pyzo installation instructions

Installation should be as easy as downloading the installation file for
your platform. A list of
[all available binaries](https://github.com/pyzo/pyzo/releases) is on Github.


## Windows

* The easiest way to install Pyzo on Windows is to use the installer
  (which does not require admin rights).
* Alternatively, you can download and unpack the zip-file. You can place
  the Pyzo directory anywhere you like.


## Linux

* To install Pyzo on Linux, download and extract the archive
  corresponding to your architecture.
* In case you want to place a link on your desktop for convenience,
  icons are in the *source/pyzo/resources/appicons* folder.
* The binaries for Linux are build on a relatively old Linux
  and should therefore work on most modern Linux distros.
* You can also ``apt-get install python3-pyqt5`` and then ``python3 -m pip install pyzo``.
  See [install Pyzo using Linux system packages](install_linux).


## OS X

* To install Pyzo on Mac, mount the disk image and copy the Pyzo
  directory to to your user directory.
* The binaries are build on a relatively old version of macOS. If it does not
  work, consider upgrading your OS or check an [older Pyzo release](https://github.com/pyzo/pyzo/releases)


## Uninstalling

To remove Pyzo distro, either run the uninstaller (when you used the
installer on Windows), or simply remove the directory that you unpacked
from the archive.

## Eula
