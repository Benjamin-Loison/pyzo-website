# Why is there on ad  on this website?

I've worked on Pyzo (and other open source software) for over 10 years.
For free. Because I believe that tools like these should be open and
free. Since 2015 I'm combining this with freelance work, which has
worked well enough, but balancing the two is an ongoing struggle.

A few years ago I decided to try and develop a time tracking product:
[TimeTagger.app/](https://timetagger.app/). My intention/hope is that in time,
this will generate some extra income, allowing me to spend more
time on FOSS (like a new version of Pyzo!).
