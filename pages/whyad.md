# Why is there on ad  on this website?

I've worked on Pyzo (and other open source software) for over 10 years.
For free. Because I believe in free software. In the last few years I've
combined it with freelance work, which has worked well enough, but
balancing the two is an ongoing struggle.

Last year I decided to develop a product for myself: [TimeTurtle.app](https://timeturtle.app).
It's (of course) build with Python. I hope that it will generate a steady (basic) income,
allowing me to spend more time on FOSS (like a new version of Pyzo!).

Give [TimeTurtle](https://timeturtle.app) a try, you might like it!
